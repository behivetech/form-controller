Archiving this project due to finding a good library already created... React Hook Form [https://react-hook-form.com/]. This libarary was not finished, but was close.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a React custom hook to use with forms. It adds the following functionality to your form

- client side field validation
- prevents multiple form submissions
- disables submit button when form is submitting or when there are field/form errors.

This is still a work in progress. It is not ready and in the middle of testing it. Documentation of the usage to come.
